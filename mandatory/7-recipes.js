/** 

The Recipe Card
Never forget another recipe!

Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. 

It should have properties for 

- title (a string), 
- servings (a number), and 
- ingredients (an array of strings)

On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:

Mole
Serves: 2
Ingredients:
cinnamon
cumin
cocoa

You should write and log at least 5 recipes
